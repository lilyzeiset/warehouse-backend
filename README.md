# Backend for Project 1

I ended up rebuilding my project with a more simplified db schema, but somehow my commit history got lost in the process.
Luckily I backed it up locally so I was able to re-push them to a new repo.
There probably is a way to re-add them here but I didn't want to risk messing it up more (git is confusing).
